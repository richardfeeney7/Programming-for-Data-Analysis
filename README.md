# Introduction

### Project Outline And Objectives
<div align="justify"> The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. You are
required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
</div><br>

<div align="justify">
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.<br><br>
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.<br><br>
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.<br><br>
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### How To Run The Boston House Prices Dataset
<div align="justify">
1. Download Cmder command line or use the command line on your computer.<br><br>
2. Go to Github, find my repository or use the following link https://github.com/richardfeeney7/Programming-for-Data-Analysis. Click on the Clone/Download button and select download zip. <br><br>
3. Once downloaded go to the command line and navigate to this  download using the cd command. When I download the zip file, I first had to unzip it and cd into it, and within that folder I had another folder that I need to cd into also.<br><br>
4. Once in the correct location type Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook into the command like. This will open a web server where you can access the files. Depending on the settings this might open Internet Explorer, I would recommend closing that web page and use the web address that you can see in the command line. <br><br>
5. When you open the web server and can view my project file, open the <u><b><i>.ipynb</i></b></u> document to view the project. <br><br>
